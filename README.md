Hi, I'm Warren Falk.  I'm interested in distributed architectures, especially with respect to data storage and management and real time processing.

I love to work at and understand the lower levels of things.  I don't just use databases and orchestrators and message brokers, etc., I like to be involved in engineering them, coding them and thinking about how they work.

I am also an open source enthusiast, contributor, and maintainer.

I love to work with great engineers who are masters at their craft.
